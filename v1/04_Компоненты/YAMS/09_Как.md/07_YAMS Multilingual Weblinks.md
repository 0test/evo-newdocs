### How can I create a multilingual weblink ?

Weblinks can be associated with multilingual templates just like standard documents. When using a multilingual weblink the multilingual content fields should be used to specify the link destination for each language.

Each language can link to a different internal or external resource. URLs or Evo document numbers should be placed in the content fields. Please make sure that the Rich Text Editor is turned off otherwise it may attempt to wrap the URL / document number in an HTML block element.

A multilingual weblink can be used to redirect to its first child document. This can be used as an alternative to the "FirstChildRedirect" snippet, which doesn't work with YAMS (without modifications).
