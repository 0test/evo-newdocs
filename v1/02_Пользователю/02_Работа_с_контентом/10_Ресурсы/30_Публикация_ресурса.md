Publishing a Resource
Publishing a page / document / resource
When you create a new resource it may be un-published (ie. it can't be viewed on the front end of the website) by default.

Reasons for this can be:

Your user account type may not have permission to publish documents - Ask your administrator
Pages are not set to publish by default, this setting is in the system configuration


If the document is unpublished it will appear in the document tree in "italic red", indicating that it is not yet published.



To publish a resource
Click on the document that you wish to edit and then click "Edit" in the Action icons.



Click on the Page Settings tab.



Tick the "Published" button or set a date in the "Publish date" field



Once you have finished click Save.



The document will now appear in a dark color in the document tree.
